## ‚òÅÔ∏è Detailed Deployment Steps (Netlify)

This is a static site (HTML, CSS, JS) optimized for quick deployment via Netlify, which is essential for the contact form functionality.

### 1\. Initial Setup

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Ensure all files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`, `Bg.mp4`, `Vaishnavi.jpeg`) are pushed to this repository.
2.  **Connect to Netlify:** Log in to your Netlify account and click **"Add new site"** $\rightarrow$ **"Import an existing project"**.
3.  Select **"Deploy with GitHub"** and choose this `portfolio` repository.

### 2\. Build Settings

  * **Build Command:** Leave **blank** (No compilation needed for static HTML).
  * **Publish Directory:** Leave **blank** (Netlify defaults to the repository root `/`).
  * Click **"Deploy site"**. Netlify will automatically publish the site.

### 3\. Contact Form Activation

The form relies on Netlify to detect its HTML attributes (`data-netlify="true"`):

1.  After the site deploys, go to the **Forms** tab in your Netlify dashboard.
2.  Verify that a form named **`contact`** has been detected.
3.  **Enable Email Notifications:** Manually configure an email notification under the form's settings so you are alerted immediately when a user hits "Submit Inquiry" via the JavaScript logic in `script.js`.
